We wanted to determine the skills required for the top data analyst roles: Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer. In order to find the most sought after skills employers are seeking for each position, we scraped a popular job board, Indeed.com, to obtain job title, job description, location, etc. for positions posted in California. Next, we combined the data and used a Natural Language Processing model to analyze the importance of words within the job descriptions and have determined a confidence rating for the top data analyst roles. Finally, we used Tableau to create visualizations of the data to understand the importance and frequency of the words.
